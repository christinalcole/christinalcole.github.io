		<h3>10 Reasons I Decided To Learn Software Development</h3>

		<p>prompt: "Why did you decide to learn software development?"

		answer: "Because all positions for fairy princess were taken, and the job outlook for that field--per the Bureau of Labor Statistics--wasn't looking good (actually, when searching the Occupational Outlook Handbook for 'fairy princess' the return is 'No Results.'  So the job outlook is probably worse than it initially appears....)."

		Kidding aside (although, seriously, how cool would it be to rock a magic wand and pixie dust?...), this first blog post is the only one in Learn's program that comes with a required prompt.  After careful consideration, my (second) official answer is "well, why wouldn't I?"  To elaborate, and with some shameless help from <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/careers/ten-signs-career-coding-software-development-right-for-you" target=_blank>Frank Wales' article for The Guardian</a></span>, I give you 10 Reasons Why I Decided to Learn Software Development....because Everyone.  Who.  Knows.  tells me that list-based articles are so popular (Don't believe me?  You don't have to: ask Google "why are lists so popular"...):

		

		"1.  You're a problem-solving pro"

		Seriously?  Isn't some variation of "excellent problem solver" in, oh, every job description on the planet?  Labeling oneself as "pro" is a bit like throwing around "expert:" I find it usually works best when the label is given by others.  I will say that it gets under my last fingernail when things don't work as advertised.

		"2.  You have a passion for strategy games"

		Not gonna lie: I suck at chess.  I get too distracted by moving the knights around that the bishop and rook sneak in every single time.  But I play a mean game of spades (right down to bidding blind), and like to think I'm on my way to mid-Atlantic status as a Cuban dominoes player.

		"3.  You have a musical mind"

		I can't carry a tune in a bucket truck.  But I am slowly teaching myself to play classical guitar and the ukulele (slowly.  very slowly.  All those sheet music notes run together....but goals are important!)  In grade school, I started learning the cello--till the Big Yellow Fellow put an end to that; aside from character-building, that experience must count for something.

		"4.  You have a talent for winning arguments"

		I'm leaving this one for my friends and family.  Discuss among yourselves.  Please be nice ;)

		"5.  You love making things"

		"...in the digital world, you aren't constrained by practicalities like materials and space..."  Hello, pixie dust!! Because I often have big ideas--bigger than the garage or my hobby desk can handle.  I've restored furniture, made a custom fascinator for a Preakness party, and have a US patent.  Right now, I'm trying to figure out how to build a web app that keeps track of regatta results so I don't have to--glue gun and glitter not required.

		"6.  You're a people person"

		Like a people-people person?  Like a motivational-speaker or crowd-warmer-upper people-person?  No, not so much...but I _do_ enjoy helping people understand.  I certainly want to be understood.  Clear, concise, effective communication is paramount to me, so...check by #6.

		"7.  You'd like to know more about the theory of computer science"

		'Why?' might just be my favorite question.  Don't get me wrong: I like knowing _how_ to do something, so that I can get on with my business, but knowing _why_ is what lets me go beyond, figure out a bigger/better/insert-superlative-here way.

		"8.  You're a team player"

		Again, seriously (see #1, above)?  That said, coding's lack of one-and-only-one way to solve a problem is a big plus for me.  Thing is, it's hard to come up with multiple _other_ solutions once you figure out one that works.  It's why I love my online peeps (looking at you, members of learn_neighbors_oo on slack!): we code in slightly different ways, learn from each other's successes (and failures).  I'm definitely a better coder because of it.

		"9.  You are intrinsically motivated"

		There are scads of books out there on intrinsic motivation.  I think it boils down to this: are you the person in the limelight, or are you the person that checks for the burned-out bulb before the show starts--because it would be awkward if the limelight didn't even come on?  I'd answer, but I've got another socket to check...

		"10.  You love technology"

		I love that Frank starts this one with "This is fairly obvious..."  Of course it is!  A software developer that doesn't love technology must be like, I don't know, Santa without elves, peanut butter without jelly, Jedi knights without The Force.  Which means I'm putting a tenth checkmark, as I use my smartphone to check the weather, order a box of Swiffers(r), find barbecue stops along the weekend's road trip, and set a reminder to write blog post #2.</p>
