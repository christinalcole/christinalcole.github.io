		<h3>10 Reasons I Decided To Learn Software Development</h3>
		<h4>posted September 1, 2016</h4>

		<div id = "inset-text">
			<p>Q: "Why did you decide to learn software development?"<br>

			A: "Because all positions for fairy princess were taken, and the job outlook for that field--per the Bureau of Labor Statistics--wasn't looking good (actually, when searching the Occupational Outlook Handbook for 'fairy princess' the return is 'No Results.'  So the job outlook is probably worse than I think...)."<br></p>

			<p>Kidding aside (although, seriously, how cool would it be to rock a magic wand and pixie dust?...), this first blog post is the only one in Learn's program that comes with a required prompt. After careful consideration, my (second) official answer is "well, why wouldn't I?" To elaborate, and with some shameless help from <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/careers/ten-signs-career-coding-software-development-right-for-you" target=_blank>Frank Wales' article for The Guardian</a></span>, I give you 10 Reasons Why I Decided to Learn Software Development....because Everyone. Who. Knows. tells me that list-based articles are so popular (Don't believe me?  You don't have to: ask Google "why are lists so popular"...):</p>

			<ol>

				<li>You're a problem-solving pro</li>

				<p>Seriously? Isn't some variation of "excellent problem solver" in, oh, every job description on the planet? Labeling oneself as "pro" is a bit like throwing around "expert:" I find it usually works best when the label is given by others. Instead, I will say that it gets under my last fingernail when things don't work as advertised.</p>

				<li>You have a passion for strategy games</li>

				<p>Not gonna lie: I suck at chess. I get too distracted by moving the knights around that the bishop and rook sneak in every single time. But I play a mean game of spades (right down to bidding blind), and like to think I'm on my way to mid-Atlantic status as a Cuban dominoes player.</p>

				<li>You have a musical mind</li>

				<p>I can't carry a tune in a bucket truck. But I am slowly teaching myself to play classical guitar and the ukulele (slowly. very slowly. All those sheet music notes run together....but goals are important!) In grade school, I started learning the cello--till the Big Yellow Fellow put an end to that; beyond character-building, that experience must count for something towards my software-developer future</p>

				<li>You have a talent for winning arguments</li>

				<p>I'm leaving this one for my friends and family. Discuss among yourselves. Be nice. Please. <i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

				<li>You love making things</li>

				<p>"...in the digital world, you aren't constrained by practicalities like materials and space..." Hello, pixie dust!! Because I often have big ideas--bigger than the garage or my hobby desk can handle. I've restored furniture, made a custom fascinator for a Preakness party, and have a US patent. Right now, I'm trying to figure out how to build a web app that keeps track of regatta results so I don't have to--glue gun and glitter not required.</p>

				<li>You're a people person</li>

				<p>Like a people-people person? Like a motivational-speaker or crowd-warmer-upper people-person? No, not so much...but I _do_ enjoy helping people understand. I certainly want to be understood. Clear, concise, effective communication is paramount to me, so...check by #6.</p>

				<li>You'd like to know more about the theory of computer science</li>

				<p>'Why?' might just be my favorite question. Don't get me wrong: I like knowing how to do something, so that I can get on with my business, but knowing <em>why</em> is what lets me go beyond, figure out a bigger/better/insert-superlative-here way.</p>

				<li>You're a team player</li>

				<p>Again, seriously (see #1, above)? That said, coding's lack of one-and-only-one way to solve a problem is a big plus for me. Thing is, it's hard to come up with multiple _other_ solutions once you figure out one that works. It's why I love my online peeps (looking at <em>you</em>, members of learn_neighbors_oo on Slack!): we think in different ways, code in different ways, learn from each other's successes and failures. I'm definitely a better coder because of them.</p>

				<li>You are intrinsically motivated</li>

				<p>There are scads of books out there on intrinsic motivation. I think it boils down to this: are you the person in the limelight, or are you the person that checks for the burned-out bulb before the show starts--because it would be awkward if the limelight didn't even come on? I'd answer, but I've got another socket to check...</p>

				<li>10.  You love technology</li>

				<p>I <i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i> that Frank starts this one with "This is fairly obvious..." Of course it is! A software developer that doesn't love technology must be like, I don't know, Santa without elves, peanut butter without jelly, Jedi knights without The Force. Which means I'm putting down a tenth checkmark, as I use my smartphone to check the weather, order a box of Swiffers&reg, find barbecue stops along this weekend's road trip, and set a reminder to write blog post #2.</p>
